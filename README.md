# FlaskApp-API
This project demonstrates the development and consumption of a REST API using Flask. The project includes: 1)A basic Flask web application demonstrating static and dynamic routing. 2)A RESTful API that provides campus data in JSON format. 3)A Python client script that sends HTTP requests to the API and processes responses.

📌 Project Overview

FlaskApp-API is a backend web application built using Python and Flask that demonstrates RESTful API development and API consumption.

This project includes:
	•	A Flask-based REST API
	•	JSON data handling
	•	Proper HTTP status codes
	•	A Python client script that consumes the API

It simulates a campus information service and demonstrates how backend systems communicate using HTTP.

⸻

🚀 Features
	•	Health check endpoint (/api/health)
	•	Retrieve all campus records (/api/items)
	•	Retrieve a specific campus by ID (/api/items/<id>)
	•	JSON responses with status codes (200, 404)
	•	Basic error handling
	•	Separate client script for API testing

⸻

🧠 How It Works
	1.	The Flask application runs a local server on port 5001.
	2.	Campus data is stored in an in-memory list (simulating a database).
	3.	API routes process HTTP requests and return JSON responses.
	4.	The client.py script sends requests using the requests library.
	5.	The API responds with data or appropriate error messages.

This demonstrates real-world backend fundamentals including routing, request handling, and client-server communication.

📊 Dataset

This project uses water quality data from BB_WQ.csv, which contains environmental sensor readings including temperature, salinity, pH, turbidity, and oxygen levels. The dataset is used to populate the MongoDB Atlas database for API testing and demonstration.
